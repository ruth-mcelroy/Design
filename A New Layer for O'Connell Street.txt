A New Layer For O’Connell Street
Ruth McElroy

The layers of Buildings on O’Connell Street show its eclectic culture. Each layer of building highlights the values of the time it was built; the uniformity of the Georgian in number 42, the control and monumentality of the British government in the GPO and the rise in entertainment of the Carlton. Instead of the eclectic mix of Architecture on O’Connell Street being derided it should be explored and celebrated. This project is adding another layer to O’Connell Street’s architecture.

The Architecture added to O’Connell Street spine is in three layers. The first, the skywalk, gives the pedestrian a new appreciation of what is already in O’Connell Street. You can see familiar buildings and statues from new angles and engage with them in new ways. This layer also references and includes the past, for example a spiral stairs and viewing platform returns what was destroyed when Nelson’s Pillar was blown up.

The second layer on the ground strengthens what is on O’Connell Street. It provides a safe lockup and a hangout spot for the couriers that use the area. Seating is added for the tourists of the GPO. Protest platforms are added as a gathering point for the protests and parades that occur on O’Connell Street. These also provide shelter for those waiting on the taxi rank. This layer also gives glimpses to the layer below.

The third layer underground adds a new dimension to O’Connell Street. It provides exhibition spaces for the underrepresented cultures in Ireland, political meeting spaces for those who want to take their protests further, a bicycle workshop and safe play spaces for children and young adults. These layers intermingle and reinforce each other throughout the whole length of the O’Connell Street spine.
